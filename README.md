## **Overview of Analysis**

### ***Purpose***

The purpose of this project was to analyze the Amazon Vine program to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

*Technologies used: AWS, RDS, Python, PySpark, Google Colab Notebooks*

## **Results**

By leveraging PySpark, I was able to analyze the dataset to determine the answers to the questions below. 

***How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?***

The total number of Vine reviews is 4 compared to the total number of reviews for users who do not use Vine, which is 1,064.

***How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?***

The total number of 5 star reviews for users with Vine is 1 whereas the total number of 5 star reviews for users who do not use Vine is 527.

***What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?***

The total percentage of 5 star reviews for users with Vine is 25% whereas the percentage for users who do not use Vine is 50%.

## **Summary**

Based on this analysis, there does not seem to be any positivity bias toward Vine users or reviews completed by Vine users. Additional analysis that could be helpful in determining if there is any bias would be to conduct a statistical analysis of the datasets.
